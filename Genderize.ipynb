For other uses  see Feminine (disambiguation) . Attributes associated with women Venus with a Mirror ( c. 1555) by Titian   showing the goddess Venus as the personification of femininity. Femininity (also called womanliness ) is a set of attributes  behaviors  and roles generally associated with women and girls . Femininity can be understood as socially constructed   [1] [2] and there is also some evidence that some behaviors considered feminine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. [1] [3] [4] [5] To what extent femininity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. [3] [4] [5] It is conceptually distinct from both the female biological sex and from womanhood  as all humans can exhibit feminine and masculine traits  regardless of sex and gender . [2] Traits traditionally cited as feminine include gracefulness  gentleness   empathy   humility   and sensitivity   though traits associated with femininity vary across societies and individuals  and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors. Overview and history [ edit ] The Birth of Venus (1486  Uffizi ) is a classic representation of femininity painted by Sandro Botticelli . [6] [7] Venus was a Roman goddess principally associated with love  beauty and fertility . Despite the terms femininity and masculinity being in common usage  there is little scientific agreement about what femininity and masculinity are. [3] : 5 Among scholars  the concept of femininity has varying meanings. [8] Professor of English Tara Williams has suggested that modern notions of femininity in English-speaking society began during the medieval period at the time of the bubonic plague in the 1300s. [9] Women in the Early Middle Ages were referred to simply within their traditional roles of maiden   wife   or widow . [9] : 4 After the Black Death in England wiped out approximately half the population  traditional gender roles of wife and mother changed  and opportunities opened up for women in society. The words femininity and womanhood are first recorded in Chaucer around 1380. [10] [11] In 1949  French intellectual Simone de Beauvoir wrote that \"no biological  psychological or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society\" and \"one is not born  but rather becomes  a woman\". [12] The idea was picked up in 1959 by Canadian-American sociologist Erving Goffman [13] and in 1990 by American philosopher Judith Butler   [14] who theorized that gender is not fixed or inherent but is rather a socially defined set of practices and traits that have  over time  grown to become labelled as feminine or masculine. [15] Goffman argued that women are socialized to present themselves as \"precious  ornamental and fragile  uninstructed in and ill-suited for anything requiring muscular exertion\" and to project \"shyness  reserve and a display of frailty  fear and incompetence\". [16] Scientific efforts to measure femininity and masculinity were pioneered by psychologists Lewis Terman and Catherine Cox Miles in the 1930s. Their M–F model was adopted by other researchers and psychologists. The model posited that femininity and masculinity were innate and enduring qualities  not easily measured  opposite to one another  and that imbalances between them led to mental disorders. [17] Alongside the women\\'s movement of the 1970s  researchers began to move away from the M–F model  developing an interest in androgyny . [17] The Bem Sex Role Inventory and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire were developed to measure femininity and masculinity on separate scales. Using such tests  researchers found that the two dimensions varied independently of one another  casting doubt on the earlier view of femininity and masculinity as opposing qualities. [17] Second-wave feminists   influenced by de Beauvoir  believed that although biological differences between females and males were innate  the concepts of femininity and masculinity had been culturally constructed  with traits such as passivity and tenderness assigned to women and aggression and intelligence assigned to men. [18] [19] Girls  second-wave feminists said  were then socialized with toys  games  television  and school into conforming to feminine values and behaviors. [18] In her significant 1963 book The Feminine Mystique   American feminist Betty Friedan wrote that the key to women\\'s subjugation lay in the social construction of femininity as childlike  passive  and dependent  [20] and called for a \"drastic reshaping of the cultural image of femininity.\" [21] Behavior and personality [ edit ] See also: Sex differences in psychology   Feminine psychology   and Nature versus nurture Traits such as nurturance  sensitivity  sweetness  [8] supportiveness  [22] [23] gentleness  [23] [24] warmth  [22] [24] passivity  cooperativeness  expressiveness  [17] modesty  humility  empathy  [23] affection  tenderness  [22] and being emotional  kind  helpful  devoted  and understanding [24] have been cited as stereotypically feminine. The defining characteristics of femininity vary between and even within societies. [22] Young Woman Drawing (1801  Metropolitan Museum of Art ) painted by Marie-Denise Villers (possibly a self-portrait)  depicts an independent feminine spirit. [25] The relationship between feminine socialization and heterosexual relationships has been studied by scholars  as femininity is related to women\\'s and girls\\' sexual appeal to men and boys. [8] Femininity is sometimes linked with sexual objectification . [26] [27] Sexual passiveness  or sexual receptivity  is sometimes considered feminine while sexual assertiveness and sexual desire are sometimes considered masculine. [27] Scholars have debated the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behaviors are due to socialization versus biological factors. [5] : 29 [28] [29] Social and biological influences are thought to be mutually interacting during development. [5] : 29 [4] : 218–225 Studies of prenatal androgen exposure have provided some evidence that femininity and masculinity are partly biologically determined. [3] : 8–9 [4] : 153–154 Other possible biological influences include evolution   genetics   epigenetics   and hormones (both during development and in adulthood). [5] : 29–31 [3] : 7–13 [4] : 153–154 In 1959  researchers such as John Money and Anke Ehrhardt proposed the prenatal hormone theory. Their research argues that sexual organs bathe the embryo with hormones in the womb  resulting in the birth of an individual with a distinctively male or female brain  this was suggested by some to \"predict future behavioral development in a masculine or feminine direction\". [30] This theory  however  has been criticized on theoretical and empirical grounds and remains controversial. [31] [32] In 2005  scientific research investigating sex differences in psychology showed that gender expectations and stereotype threat affect behavior  and a person\\'s gender identity can develop as early as three years of age. [33] Money also argued that gender identity is formed during a child\\'s first three years. [29] People who exhibit a combination of both masculine and feminine characteristics are considered androgynous   and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification. [34] [35] Modern conceptualizations of femininity also rely not just upon social constructions  but upon the individualized choices made by women. [36] Philosopher Mary Vetterling-Braggin argues that all characteristics associated with femininity arose from early human sexual encounters which were mainly male-forced and female-unwilling  because of male and female anatomical differences. [37] [ page needed ] Others  such as Carole Pateman   Ria Kloppenborg  and Wouter J. Hanegraaff   argue that the definition of femininity is the result of how females must behave in order to maintain a patriarchal social system . [26] [38] In his 1998 book Masculinity and Femininity: the Taboo Dimension of National Cultures   Dutch psychologist and researcher Geert Hofstede wrote that only behaviors directly connected with procreation can  strictly speaking  be described as feminine or masculine  and yet every society worldwide recognizes many additional behaviors as more suitable to females than males  and vice versa. He describes these as relatively arbitrary choices mediated by cultural norms and traditions  identifying \"masculinity versus femininity\" as one of five basic dimensions in his theory of cultural dimensions . Hofstede describes as feminine behaviors including service  permissiveness  and benevolence  and describes as feminine those countries stressing equality  solidarity  quality of work-life   and the resolution of conflicts by compromise and negotiation. [39] [40] In Carl Jung \\'s school of analytical psychology   the anima and animus are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind. The anima and animus are described by Jung as elements of his theory of the collective unconscious   a domain of the unconscious that transcends the personal psyche. In the unconscious of the male  it finds expression as a feminine inner personality: anima  equivalently  in the unconscious of the female  it is expressed as a masculine inner personality: animus. [41] Clothing and appearance [ edit ] Main articles: Physical attractiveness § Female   and Clothing § Gender differentiation See also: Gendered associations of pink and blue In Western cultures  the ideal of feminine appearance has traditionally included long  flowing hair  clear skin  a narrow waist  and little or no body hair or facial hair. [2] [42] [43] In other cultures  however  some expectations are different. For example  in many parts of the world  underarm hair is not considered unfeminine. [44] Today  the color pink is strongly associated with femininity  whereas in the early 1900s pink was associated with boys and blue with girls. [45] These feminine ideals of beauty have been criticized as restrictive  unhealthy  and even racist. [43] [46] In particular  the prevalence of anorexia and other eating disorders in Western countries has frequently been blamed on the modern feminine ideal of thinness. [47] Muslim woman wearing a headdress (Hijab) In many Muslim countries  women are required to cover their heads with a hijab (veil). It is considered a symbol of feminine modesty and morality. [48] [49] Some  however  see it as a symbol of objectification and oppression. [50] [51] In history [ edit ] In some cultures  cosmetics are associated with femininity Cultural standards vary on what is considered feminine. For example  in 16th century France  high heels were considered a distinctly masculine type of shoe  though they are currently considered feminine. [52] [53] In Ancient Egypt   sheath and beaded net dresses were considered female clothing  while wraparound dresses  perfumes   cosmetics  and elaborate jewelry were worn by both men and women. In Ancient Persia   clothing was generally unisex   though women wore veils and headscarves . Women in Ancient Greece wore himations   and in Ancient Rome women wore the palla   a rectangular mantle  and the maphorion. [54] The typical feminine outfit of aristocratic women of the Renaissance was an undershirt with a gown and a high-waisted overgown  and a plucked forehead and beehive or turban-style hairdo. [54] Body alteration [ edit ] Main article: Body alteration Body alteration is the deliberate altering of the human body for aesthetic or non-medical purpose. [55] One such purpose has been to induce perceived feminine characteristics in women. For centuries in Imperial China   smaller feet were considered to be a more aristocratic characteristic in women. The practice of foot binding was intended to enhance this characteristic  though it made walking difficult and painful. [56] [57] In a few parts of Africa and Asia  neck rings are worn in order to elongate the neck. In these cultures  a long neck characterizes feminine beauty. [58] The Padaung of Burma and Tutsi women of Burundi   for instance  practice this form of body modification. [59] [60] In China until the twentieth century  tiny  bound feet for women were considered aristocratic and feminine The Kayan people of Burma (Myanmar) associate the wearing of neck rings with feminine beauty. [61] Traditional roles [ edit ] Main article: Gender roles Teacher in a classroom in Madagascar (c. 2008). Primary and secondary school teaching is often considered a feminine occupation. Femininity as a social construct relies on a binary gender system that treats men and masculinity as different from  and opposite to  women and femininity. [8] In patriarchal societies  including Western ones  conventional attitudes to femininity contribute to the subordination of women  as women are seen as more compliant  vulnerable  and less prone to violence. [8] Gender stereotypes influence traditional feminine occupations  resulting in microaggression toward women who break traditional gender roles. [62] These stereotypes include that women have a caring nature  have skill at household-related work  have greater manual dexterity than men  are more honest than men  and have a more attractive physical appearance. Occupational roles associated with these stereotypes include: midwife   teacher   accountant   data entry clerk   cashier   salesperson  receptionist   housekeeper   cook   maid   social worker   and nurse . [63] Occupational segregation maintains gender inequality [64] and the gender pay gap . [65] Certain medical specializations  such as surgery and emergency medicine   are dominated by a masculine culture [66] and have a higher salary. [67] [68] Leadership is associated with masculinity in Western culture and women are perceived less favorably as potential leaders. [69] However  some people have argued that feminine-style leadership  which is associated with leadership that focuses on help and cooperation  is advantageous over masculine leadership  which is associated with focusing on tasks and control. [70] Female leaders are more often described by Western media using characteristics associated with femininity  such as emotion. [70] Explanations for occupational imbalance [ edit ] Psychologist Deborah L. Best argues that primary sex characteristics of men and women  such as the ability to bear children  caused a historical sexual division of labor and that gender stereotypes evolved culturally to perpetuate this division. [71] The practice of bearing children tends to interrupt the continuity of employment. According to human capital theory  this retracts from the female investment in higher education and employment training. Richard Anker of the International Labour Office argues human capital theory does not explain the sexual division of labor because many occupations tied to feminine roles  such as administrative assistance  require more knowledge  experience  and continuity of employment than low-skilled masculinized occupations  such as truck driving . Anker argues the feminization of certain occupations limits employment options for women. [63] Role congruity theory [ edit ] Role congruity theory proposes that people tend to view deviations from expected gender roles negatively. It supports the empirical evidence that gender discrimination exists in areas traditionally associated with one gender or the other. It is sometimes used to explain why people have a tendency to evaluate behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman. [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Religion and politics [ edit ] The Altai consider shamanism a feminine role. [77] Asian religions [ edit ] Shamanism may have originated as early as the Paleolithic period  predating all organized religions. [78] [79] Archeological finds have suggested that the earliest known shamans were female  [80] and contemporary shamanic roles such as the Korean mudang continue to be filled primarily by women. [81] [82] In Hindu traditions  Devi is the female aspect of the divine. Shakti is the divine feminine creative power  the sacred force that moves through the entire universe [83] and the agent of change. She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect  which represents consciousness or discrimination  remains impotent and void. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord  she is also called Prakriti   the basic nature of intelligence by which the Universe exists and functions. In Hinduism   the universal creative force Yoni is feminine   with inspiration being the life force of creation. Yin and yang In Taoism   the concept of yin represents the primary force of the female half of yin and yang . The yin is also present  to a smaller proportion  in the male half. The yin can be characterized as slow  soft  yielding  diffuse  cold  wet  and passive. [84] Abrahamic theology [ edit ] Holy Wisdom: Hagia Sophia Although the Abrahamic God is typically described in masculine terms—such as father or king —many theologians argue that this is not meant to indicate the gender of God . [85] According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church   God \"is neither man nor woman: he is God\". [86] Several recent writers  such as feminist theologian Sallie McFague   have explored the idea of \"God as mother\"  examining the feminine qualities attributed to God. For example  in the Book of Isaiah   God is compared to a mother comforting her child  while in the Book of Deuteronomy   God is said to have given birth to Israel. [85] The Book of Genesis describes the divine creation of the world out of nothing or ex nihilo . In Wisdom literature and in the wisdom tradition   wisdom is described as feminine. In many books of the Old Testament  including Wisdom and Sirach   wisdom is personified and called she . According to David Winston  because wisdom is God\\'s \"creative agent \" she must be intimately identified with God. [87] The Wisdom of God is feminine in Hebrew : Chokhmah   in Arabic : Hikmah   in Greek : Sophia   and in Latin : Sapientia . In Hebrew   both Shekhinah (the Holy Spirit and divine presence of God) and Ruach HaKodesh (divine inspiration) are feminine. [ citation needed ] In Christian Kabbalah   Chokhmah (wisdom and intuition) is the force in the creative process that God used to create the heavens and the earth. Binah (understanding and perception) is the great mother  the feminine receiver of energy and giver of form. Binah receives the intuitive insight from Chokhmah and dwells on it in the same way that a mother receives the seed from the father  and keeps it within her until it\\'s time to give birth. The intuition  once received and contemplated with perception  leads to the creation of the Universe . [88] Communism [ edit ] Porcelain statue of a woman in communist China - Cat Street Market  Hong Kong Communist revolutionaries initially depicted idealized womanhood as muscular  plainly dressed and strong  [89] with good female communists shown as undertaking hard manual labour  using guns  and eschewing self-adornment. [90] Contemporary Western journalists portrayed communist states as the enemy of traditional femininity  describing women in communist countries as \"mannish\" perversions. [91] [92] In revolutionary China in the 1950s  Western journalists described Chinese women as \"drably dressed  usually in sloppy slacks and without makeup  hair waves or nail polish\" and wrote that \"Glamour was communism\\'s earliest victim in China. You can stroll the cheerless streets of Peking all day  without seeing a skirt or a sign of lipstick  without thrilling to the faintest breath of perfume  without hearing the click of high heels  or catching the glint of legs sheathed in nylon.\" [93] [94] In communist Poland   changing from high heels to worker\\'s boots symbolized women\\'s shift from the bourgeois to socialism .\" [95] Later  the initial state portrayals of idealized femininity as strong and hard-working began to also include more traditional notions such as gentleness  caring and nurturing behaviour  softness  modesty and moral virtue  [89] [96] : 53 requiring good communist women to become \"superheroes who excelled in all spheres\"  including working at jobs not traditionally regarded as feminine in nature. [96] : 55–60 Communist ideology explicitly rejected some aspects of traditional femininity that it viewed as bourgeois and consumerist  such as helplessness  idleness and self-adornment. In Communist countries  some women resented not having access to cosmetics and fashionable clothes. In her 1993 book of essays How We Survived Communism & Even Laughed   Croatian journalist and novelist Slavenka Drakulic wrote about \"a complaint I heard repeatedly from women in Warsaw  Budapest  Prague  Sofia  East Berlin: \\'Look at us – we don\\'t even look like women. There are no deodorants  perfumes  sometimes even no soap or toothpaste. There is no fine underwear  no pantyhose  no nice lingerie[\\']\" [97] : 31 and \"Sometimes I think the real Iron Curtain is made of silky  shiny images of pretty women dressed in wonderful clothes  of pictures from women\\'s magazines ... The images that cross the borders in magazines  movies or videos are therefore more dangerous than any secret weapon  because they make one desire that \\'otherness\\' badly enough to risk one\\'s life trying to escape.\" [97] : 28–9 As communist countries such as Romania and the Soviet Union began to liberalize  their official media began representing women in more conventionally feminine ways compared with the \"rotund farm workers and plain-Jane factory hand\" depictions they had previously been publishing. As perfumes  cosmetics  fashionable clothing  and footwear became available to ordinary women in the Soviet Union  East Germany   Poland  Yugoslavia and Hungary   they began to be presented not as bourgeois frivolities but as signs of socialist modernity. [98] In China  with the economic liberation started by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s  the state stopped discouraging women from expressing conventional femininity  and gender stereotypes and commercialized sexualization of women which had been suppressed under communist ideology began to rise. [99] In men [ edit ] See also: Effeminacy Flowers and makeup are stereotypically associated with femininity in Western culture. [100] [101] In many cultures  men who display qualities considered feminine are often stigmatized and labeled as weak. [8] Effeminate men are often associated with homosexuality   [102] [103] although femininity is not necessarily related to a man\\'s sexual orientation. [104] Because men are pressured to be masculine and heterosexual  feminine men are assumed to be gay or queer because of how they perform their gender. This assumption limits the way one is allowed to express one\\'s gender and sexuality. [105] [106] Cross-dressing and drag are two public performances of femininity by men that have been popularly known and understood throughout many western cultures. Men who wear clothing associated with femininity are often called cross-dressers. [107] A drag queen is a man who wears flamboyant women\\'s clothing and behaves in an exaggeratedly feminine manner for entertainment purposes.

[109] Many second-wave feminists reject what they regard as constricting standards of female beauty  created for the subordination and objectifying of women and self-perpetuated by reproductive competition and women\\'s own aesthetics. [110] Others  such as lipstick feminists and some other third-wave feminists   argue that feminism should not devalue feminine culture and identity  and that symbols of feminine identity such as make-up  suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure can be valid and empowering personal choices for both sexes. [111] [112] Julia Serano notes that masculine girls and women face much less social disapproval than feminine boys and men  which she attributes to sexism. Serano argues that women wanting to be like men is consistent with the idea that maleness is more valued in contemporary culture than femaleness  whereas men being willing to give up masculinity in favour of femininity directly threatens the notion of male superiority as well as the idea that men and women should be opposites. To support her thesis  Serano cites the far greater public scrutiny and disdain experienced by male-to-female cross-dressers compared with that faced by women who dress in masculine clothes  as well as research showing that parents are likelier to respond negatively to sons who like Barbie dolls and ballet or wear nail polish than they are to daughters exhibiting comparably masculine behaviours.

( July 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In her 2007 book Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity   American transsexual writer and biologist Julia Serano offers a transfeminist critique of femininity  notable especially for its call to empower femininity: [113] [114] Serano notes that some behaviors  such as frequent smiling or avoiding eye contact with strangers  are considered feminine because they are practised disproportionately by women  and likely have resulted from women\\'s attempts to negotiate through a world which is sometimes hostile to them. [113] : 322 Serano argues that because contemporary culture is sexist  it assigns negative connotations to  or trivializes  behaviours understood to be feminine such as gossiping  behaving emotionally or decorating. It also recasts and reimagines femininity through a male heterosexual lens  for example interpreting women\\'s empathy and altruism as husband-and-child-focused rather than globally focused  and interpreting women\\'s interest in aesthetics as intended solely to entice or attract men.

Until feminists work to empower femininity and pry it away from the insipid  inferior meanings that plague it – weakness  helplessness  fragility  passivity  frivolity  and artificiality – those meanings will continue to haunt every person who is female and/or feminine. ^ Rasmussen  Debbie (2007). \"Risk: Feminine Protection (interview with Julia Serano)\" . Bitch . Archived from the original on September 15  2013 . Retrieved 15 August 2013 . The rising visibility of trans  intersex  and genderqueer movements has led feminists—and  to a lesser extent  the rest of the world—to an increasing awareness that m and f are only the beginning of the story of gender identity. With the release of Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity  Julia Serano offers a perspective sorely needed  but up until now rarely heard: a transfeminine critique of both feminist and mainstream understandings of gender.
