# Genderize

A simple model that uses linguistic features to identify the dominant gender in a piece of text. The model was inspired by an article by Neal Caren, Using Python to see how the Times writes about men and women (2013), in which a researcher applied gender analysis to the text of articles published in the New York Times and found that masculine and feminine words appear in very different contexts, which can reinforce bias.
